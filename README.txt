## Why choose print on demand?

<a href="https://www.spod.com/how-it-works/?affiliateID=12890">Print on demand (POD)</a> means that every product from your online shop is produced to order. Print-on-demand business models are a perfect way sell your own custom products without the risk of high initial investment, overstocking products, or storing inventory. SPOD enables merchants sell products featuring their own designs or branding with no need to stock, produce, print or ship anything themselves.

The POD process is also inherently more sustainable than traditional fashion business models due to reduced overstock and rock-bottom return rates.
